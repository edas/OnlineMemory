Backup and delete old tweets (in my configuration, after 2 days)

Modify settings.yml with your values, then execute backup.rb


To go further the 3200th tweet, you have to fill a formal request
to Twitter, then use the data to delete each tweet by its id
See <https://www.privacyinternational.org/blog/what-does-twitter-know-about-its-users-nologs>
You may have to be resident in the EU for that.
